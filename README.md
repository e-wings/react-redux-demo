# React Redux Demo

This is a react-redux version TODO, based on [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). The internal data flow is handled with  [react-edux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) .

This starterkit does not include some fancy UI stuff but is a lightweight starting point for your next react app.
